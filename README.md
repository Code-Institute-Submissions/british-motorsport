# British Motorsport - Front End Milestone Project

This is the Milestone project for the front end development part of the course. The site aims to provide the user with an overview of the motorsport championships and events to in the UK throughout the year.

A lot of these pages are similar but have differences. Some of the pages include photos adding to the visual effect of the site. Two to the championship pages also contain video. There are lots of outbound links to other websites, which aims to promote that championship.

## User Experience

The general pages follow the same theme follow the same structure, and contain different relevant information. From the home page the user can select whether they want to explore the championships, 

The home page has its own individual design to differentiate itself from the rest of the sub pages. At first (as can be seen in Wireframe/Front End 1) the front page was going to have the championship cards, as well as the circuits and events links at the bottom of the page. This subsequently changed following a discussion with my mentor, who suggested the front page have its own distinctive feel. 

Other than the home page, all the following pages have the same header and footer creating a consistent feel to the site. All links, including those in the navbar and external links have been given a consistent apearance and hover effect.

Links to external websites are opened in a new tab which keeps the user on the site.

## Technology Used

Following a discussion at the start of the project with my mentor, I decided not to use bootstrap for this project. It contained a lot of unecessary code that I would not need for this project, and wanted to create my own designs which I also believed would enhance my learning.

This site has been created using mobile first design. For the responsive elements of the site I have used Flexbox, and created media queries. These effects can be seen on all pages.

For mobile and tablet view sizes I have created a burger icon at the top for the navigation bar on smaller screen sizes. This was created with CSS and HTML only using a checkbox. 

## Testing

The site was tested on different screen sizes and browsers, to ensure that the site layout responds well and looks good wherever the user is looking at the site.

Every 

The HTML and CSS code was checked using online validators, and all pages were updated according to the results.
