# Front End Milestone Project - British Motorsport

## Project Description

This is the Milestone project for the front end development part of the course. 

### General Information

I have decided to build a website around British Motorsport, and it contains 10 pages. A lot of these are similar but show different championships in the same style. The circuits and events page also have a similar feel. Some of the pages include lots of photos which add to the visual effect of the site. Two to the championship pages also contain video.

I have made it a varied project, with a number of pages for different championships. These will follow the same structure, and contain different relevant information.

Each of the pages have the same header and footer creating a consistent feel to the site. 

There are lots of outbound links to other sites, and I have given the buttons for these a consistent effect.

### Responsive Design

This site has been created using mobile first design.

For the responsive elements of the site I have used Flexbox, and created media queries to determine how many elements are in each row. This can be seen on all pages. This can also be seen in the footer area.

For mobile and tablet view sizes I have created a menu burger icon at the top for the navigation bar.

### After work completed

I checked the code for the html and css on online validators, and all the pages were updated according to the results. The CSS was then minified to speed up the load time of the pages.
