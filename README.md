# Front End Milestone Project - British Motorsport

## Project Description

This is the Milestone project for the front end development part of the course. 

### General Information

I have decided to build a website around British Motorsport, and it contains 11 pages. A lot of these are similar but have differences. The circuits and events page also have a similar feel. Some of the pages include lots of photos which add to the visual effect of the site. Two to the championship pages also contain video.

I have made it a varied project, with a number of pages for different championships. These follow the same structure, and contain different relevant information.

The home page has its own individual design to differentiate itself from the rest of the sub pages. Each of the pages except for the home page have the same header and footer creating a consistent feel to the site. 

There are lots of outbound links to other sites, and the buttons for these have been given a consistent effect across the pages.

I decided not to use bootstrap for this project. I felt it contained a lot of unecessary code that I would not need in this project, and wanted to create my own designs which I also believed would enhance my learning.

### Responsive Design

This site has been created using mobile first design.

For the responsive elements of the site I have used Flexbox, and created media queries to determine how many elements are in each row. This can be seen on all pages. This can also be seen in the footer area.

For mobile and tablet view sizes I have created a burger icon at the top for the navigation bar on smaller screen sizes.

### After work completed

I checked the code for the html and css on online validators, and all the pages were updated according to the results. The site was then tested on different screen sizes and browsers.
